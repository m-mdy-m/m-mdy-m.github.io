      <h1>Genix</h1>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        I build systems that trade simplicity for scale, and question abstractions until they fall apart.
        Most of my work lives somewhere between distributed messaging, event-driven architectures, and the philosophy of arrays.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-400">
        Still learning. Still breaking my own designs.

    <!-- What I Build -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2>What I Build</h2>
      <p>
        I write code that solves problems—sometimes elegantly, sometimes through brute force iteration.
        My focus areas include:
      </p>
      <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> Building systems where components communicate through events rather than direct calls. My GLAND framework embodies this philosophy.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Structures:</strong> Not just using them, but understanding why they exist. ARLIZ is my attempt to document that journey from first principles.</li>
        <li><strong>Distributed Systems:</strong> How do we build reliable software when everything can fail? This question drives much of my research.</li>
        <li><strong>Developer Tooling:</strong> From Vim configs to CLI tools, I believe good tools amplify good thinking.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Philosophy -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        I'm fascinated by the intersection of philosophy and computation.
        How do we know what we know? What makes a proof convincing?
        Why do abstractions work—until they don't?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Writing is thinking.</strong> That's why I write books, articles, and documentation.
        Not to teach—to learn. Every explanation forces clarity. Every attempt to
        simplify reveals what I don't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Systems over solutions.</strong> How components interact matters more than what they do
        individually. Emergence is more interesting than implementation. Architecture
        outlasts code.
      </p>

    <!-- Current Work -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2>Current Focus</h2>
      <ul class="space-y-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Writing ARLIZ</strong> — A book exploring data structures from their historical origins.
          Not just "how to implement a tree" but "why did trees emerge as a useful abstraction?"
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Building GLAND</strong> — An event-driven architecture for JavaScript systems.
          Modular, protocol-agnostic, built for scale.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Algorithm Analysis</strong> — Deepening understanding of complexity theory and formal methods.
          Currently working through MATHESIS, my book on mathematical foundations.
