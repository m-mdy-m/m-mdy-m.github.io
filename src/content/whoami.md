title: About Me
description: A brief biography
---

I am Mahdi. If you prefer, you can call me by my alias: Genix. I am a student of Computer Engineering (at least at the time of writing this). I grew up with computers and I have always wondered what lies behind this screen of black and green text. There is not much you need to know about me, just that I am someone who works with computers, sometimes gives them commands, and sometimes learns from them.

#### Contact & Collaboration

I’m always open to new ideas, collaborations, and discussions—especially those that challenge conventional thinking and push the boundaries of system design. Feel free to reach out via email(bitsgenix@gmail.com) or open an issue on one of [my GitHub](https://github.com/m-mdy-m/m-mdy-m) projects.
