title: About Me
description: A brief biography
---

They call me Genix.  
I build systems that trade simplicity for scale, and question abstractions until they fall apart.  
Most of my work lives somewhere between distributed messaging, event-driven architectures, and the philosophy of arrays.  
I like tools that do one thing well — and refuse to quit.

Still learning. Still breaking my own designs.
