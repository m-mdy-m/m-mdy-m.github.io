# ARLIZ: Arrays, Reasoning, Logic, Identity, Zero

A living book that explores data structures and algorithms from their very foundations. Instead of jumping straight into code, ARLIZ begins with the historical context—from counting stones and the abacus to modern silicon chips.

## The Story

Every programmer has encountered arrays, stacks, queues, and trees. But how often do we stop to ask: *what is an array, really?* Not just how to use it, but why it exists and how it came to be.

ARLIZ emerged from this curiosity. It's built on the belief that true understanding begins with context—that knowing the journey from ancient calculation methods to modern data structures makes us better programmers.

## What Makes It Different

- **Historical Context**: We start with the abacus, not the algorithm
- **Visual Learning**: Concepts are explained through diagrams and examples
- **From Scratch**: Algorithms are built and understood, not just memorized
- **Living Document**: The book grows and evolves as new insights emerge

## Structure

The book follows a logical progression:
1. **Origins**: Ancient computing methods and early logic
2. **Evolution**: From mechanical calculators to electronic computers  
3. **Foundations**: How data structures naturally emerged from these needs
4. **Implementation**: Building structures and algorithms from first principles

## Philosophy

Understanding beats memorization. Context beats syntax. The *why* illuminates the *how*.
