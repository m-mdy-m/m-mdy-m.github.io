# NExa: Dev.to Article Fetcher

Sick of opening your browser for every dev.to update? NExa slides right into your terminal, grabs the top posts in a snap, and shows you titles, authors, and timestamps—no extra fluff.

## What’s In It?

* Pick a category (latest, programming, etc.)
* Fetch top articles from dev.to via CLI
* Pretty-print title, author, time, and excerpt
* Extend or tweak in Python—zero magic
* Docker image if you hate local setups


## Philosophy

Terminal first. No browser bloated tabs. Keep it tiny, keep it Pythonic, and get the news without leaving your shell.
