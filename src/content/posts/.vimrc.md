# VEX: My Vim, My Rules

Yeah, the name kinda says it all. This is my personal Vim config.

Clean, dark, fast. No nonsense. Just the plugins I actually use, keybindings I actually remember, and settings that make sense *to me*. If you're into minimal setups that don't fight you, maybe this works for you too.

## What’s In It?

- Handpicked plugins  
- Dark UI with sharp code visuals  
- Keybindings that don't require yoga fingers  
- A setup script so you don’t have to think

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m-mdy-m/.vimrc.git && cd .vimrc && ./script/setup
```

Run that, and you're done.

You get folders for looks, keys, and plugins—because I like it neat.
Check out the screenshots in the repo to see how it actually looks.
