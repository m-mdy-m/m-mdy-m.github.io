# TechShelf: My Digital Bookshelf

This one’s simple—just a personal stash of technical books.  
Stuff about programming, systems, AI, CS theory, and all the other rabbit holes I like falling into.

Everything’s organized into categories so I don’t lose my mind every time I need a book. That’s it.

## What’s in it?

- Programming, algorithms, AI, OS, and more  
- All in one place, sorted and searchable
