# ARLIZ: From Zero to Understanding

Sometimes the best projects start with the simplest questions. What is an array, really? Not just the syntax or the operations, but the *why* behind it all.

ARLIZ began as curiosity—a persistent itch to understand data structures from their roots rather than memorizing implementations. It's grown into something more: a living book that explores computation from counting stones to silicon chips, from ancient calculation methods to modern algorithms.

## What ARLIZ Means

**A**rrays, **R**easoning, **L**ogic, **I**dentity, **Z**ero

These aren't just buzzwords. They represent the journey from the philosophical concept of "nothing" (zero) to how we organize and manipulate data today. It's about understanding the *why* before the *how*.

## A Book That Grows

ARLIZ isn't finished—it evolves. Whenever I learn something worth writing, it gets added. Whenever I find a better way to explain a concept, it gets revised. It's less about reaching a destination and more about documenting the journey.

The book starts where most others don't: with context. We begin with the abacus, mechanical gears, and early logic—long before anyone thought of transistors. Because understanding where we came from makes where we're going much clearer.
