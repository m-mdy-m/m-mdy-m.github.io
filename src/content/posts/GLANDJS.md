# GLAND: Not a Framework

This isn’t just another JS framework.  
GLAND is an architecture. A way of thinking.

It’s modular, event-driven, and protocol-agnostic. I built it because I was tired of tools that assumed too much—and scaled too little.  
Here, everything talks via events. No hard dependencies. No magic. Just clean separation, pluggable logic, and full control.

Built for building **systems**, not just apps.
