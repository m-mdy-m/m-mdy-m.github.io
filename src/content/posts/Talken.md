# Talken: No UI, Just Messaging

This one’s not for end users.  
Talken is just the brain behind messaging—no UI, no storage, no fluff.

It’s modular, peer-to-peer, and encrypted by default. Every user is just a public key. That’s it. No emails, no passwords, no central servers. You bring your own transport, your own frontend, your own everything.

## What It Does

- Key-based identity (just keys, no accounts)  
- End-to-end encryption (no one else sees anything)  
- P2P discovery (decentralized all the way)  
- Protocol-agnostic core (embed it anywhere)

Right now it’s just scaffolding and docs—but the core is coming.  
If you’re building a secure comm layer and want full control, maybe keep an eye on this.
