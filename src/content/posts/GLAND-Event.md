# Events: Brokers, Channels, and Chaos

This is where Gland breathes.

An event broker system with namespaced channels, propagation, and strategy-based execution. It connects modules, protocols, and systems—without them even knowing about each other.

Each protocol (HTTP, WS, whatever) gets its own broker.  
Everything syncs, talks, listens. That’s the power.
