# Algorithms & Chaos

Nope, this isn’t a course.  
No polished guides, no clean diagrams. Just me, learning stuff.

This repo is where I throw everything I come across in my CS journey—algorithms, data structures, weird bugs, “aha” moments, and brain-melting problems.  
It’s chaotic. It’s honest. It’s mine.

## What You’ll Find

I've kinda organized it into levels—based on how much pain each one causes:

- **Elementary** – Baby steps.  
- **Intermediate** – Okay, things are moving.  
- **Advanced** – More thinking, more swearing.  
- **Thanos Level** – Things disappear. Sanity included.  
- **Merlin Level** – Magic and madness.

## Why?

No reason. Just documenting the chaos so I don’t forget.
