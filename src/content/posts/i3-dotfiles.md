# My i3 Dotfiles

Like every other dev out there, I’ve got my own dotfiles.  
This one’s for my i3 setup—lean, clean, and built for the keyboard.

No distractions, no bloat. Just i3, some neat keybindings, a few startup tweaks, and configs for stuff like audio, network, lock screen, `bashrc`, `rofi`, `neofetch`, and whatever else I use daily.

It’s not meant to impress.  
It’s meant to work.
