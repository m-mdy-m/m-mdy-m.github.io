# MATHESIS: The Mathematical Foundations of Computing

> *"In mathematics, you don't understand things. You just get used to them."*  
> — John von Neumann

## About This Book

MATHESIS is my attempt to understand mathematics the way it actually developed—as a series of insights, each solving a real problem or answering a genuine question. Not "here are 50 formulas to memorize" but "here's why someone needed this idea, here's what they were trying to do, here's how it connects to everything else."

This book sits between three others I'm writing:
- **MATHESIS** — the mathematical foundations
- **The Art of Algorithmic Analysis** — how to analyze algorithms rigorously
- **Arliz** — data structures in depth

## Structure

The book progresses through ten major parts:

### Part I: Logic and the Foundations of Reasoning
Before mathematics, there was logic. This part develops formal systems of propositional and predicate logic, proof theory, and the philosophical foundations that make mathematics possible.

### Part II: Set Theory: The Language of Mathematical Objects
Sets are the atoms of mathematical discourse. This part develops axiomatic set theory from ZFC, explores paradoxes, and examines philosophical implications.

### Part III: Algebraic Structures
Algebra is the study of structure. By abstracting essential properties of mathematical operations, we discover profound unifying patterns.

### Part IV: Number Theory
Number theory—once dismissed as pure mathematics—now underpins modern cryptography, pseudorandom generation, and algorithmic complexity.

### Part V: Discrete Mathematics
The native language of computer science. Combinatorics, graph theory, and the mathematics of countable structures.

### Part VI: Mathematical Analysis
From calculus to measure theory—the machinery needed to reason about algorithms' asymptotic behavior.

### Part VII: Probability Theory
The mathematical framework for reasoning under uncertainty, from measure-theoretic foundations to concentration inequalities.

### Part VIII: Topology
Properties preserved under continuous deformation. Topological thinking appears throughout computer science.

### Part IX: Formal Languages and Automata Theory
The theory of formal languages, automata, and computability—the mathematical foundations of what computers can do.

### Part X: Mathematical Logic and Foundations
The deepest questions: Can mathematics be reduced to logic? Are there mathematical truths beyond proof?

## Philosophy

This book treats mathematics not as a collection of techniques but as a way of thinking. Every major idea starts with a question:
- What problem were people trying to solve?
- Why did existing tools fail?
- What insight made progress possible?
