## What's this?

This isn't your typical chess game. It's not a Q&A session either. This is a **strategic puzzle game** where you navigate through a **16x16 maze** based on a chess piece you choose. Your goal? Reach the core, figure things out, and (maybe) checkmate me.

## How It Works

- First, **pick a piece**: King, Queen, Knight, Bishop, Rook, or Pawn.
- A **maze is generated**, based on your piece's movement style.
- Move through the maze. Every few steps, you get a **question**.
  - Answer **correctly** → The maze gets easier.
  - Answer **wrong** → The walls shift, making your path harder.
- If you mess up too much, you’ll **trap yourself**—game over.
- Get close enough to the final piece, and **the walls disappear**.
- Now, the **real challenge** begins: The board is full of mines. You have **three moves** to find the hidden prize.
  - If you step on a mine → **You're done**.
  - If you find the prize → **You win, checkmate.**

## The Vibe

The game feels like an old-school **terminal-based puzzle**. It's simple, yet tricky. Everything is built around **chess mechanics**, **mazes**, and a **mind-game element** where you’re trying to figure out the deeper meaning of what’s happening.

## Why?

Because why not? This is a mix of **strategy, logic, and mind games**. If you enjoy thinking a few steps ahead, making calculated risks, and solving puzzles that adapt to you, you’ll like this.
